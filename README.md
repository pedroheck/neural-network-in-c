# neural-network-in-c
This repository is for learning purposes only. It is intended for me to learn and practice coding Neural Networks in C without the use of external libraries.

The Neural Network developed here will be extremely simple and is designed to predict the output of an XOR function, like in the example below:

Input | Output

0  0 | 0

0  1 | 1

1  0 | 1

1  1 | 0
